# Fastspring store

This extension lets you view and manage a fastspring,
without the need for a website UI.

For example, on this site, it is possible to see only 3 products, one at 9.95â‚¬, another at 99.00â‚¬ and the last at
59.00â‚¬.
But with the extension, you can see all the products in the store, making it easier to debug the contents of the
and try to make purchases that would be impossible under normal circumstances.
